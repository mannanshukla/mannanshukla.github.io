      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By looking at the context of race, location, and time period presented in the world of the film Fences, we gain a more complete understanding of the values that various characters in and around the Maxson family hold. Despite the fact they live in a society in which they must overcome the odds to advance, various characters can take opportunities as they come and eventually overcome the bad hand they were dealt. Through this, Fences provides both a contrasting and colorful commentary on the American Dream. The discourse regarding the American Dream is typically black or white. Many decry the very idea of such a dream existing because systematic racism allows some racial groups to jump ahead of others in terms of social standing and economics. Even in the wake of this reality, proponents argue that others just need to work harder and that the dream dies due to laziness. Fences, however, shine a light on a more nuanced view. By focusing on a little-discussed period in American history, audiences across the world were exposed to an interpretation of the American Dream that balanced two contradictory, yet realistic points of view: where some will have to work extra hard to achieve the American Dream while facing unique obstacles and challenges, but the Dream is achievable in spite of this. Troy’s dream was for stability, given an abusive father and a largely agrarian way of life where he was given little chance of success, Troy was able to capture the dream for himself. He moved to Pittsburgh and got the life he wanted. However, due to his past, he was never able to let go of his hatred and let Cory succeed. He faced an uphill battle for the dream and was still able to achieve it. Cory saw where his life could improve. He wanted an education, he wanted to leave the slums, he didn’t want to work his entire life. Even though it wasn’t easy for him, Cory was able to capture his dream by becoming a corporal. He was able to advance even in the wake of his misfortune. While life isn’t fair, and the American Dream isn’t equally achievable, Fences shows us that it exists nonetheless.</p>
