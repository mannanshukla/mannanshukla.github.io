      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Race, in addition to these other factors, played a significant role in the Maxson’s manifestation of the American dream. While blacks at the time held basic rights, their economic plight had not reached national awareness, and the minimal opportunities they were given were outweighed by the deck of society which was heavily stacked against them. Many blacks at the time went to great lengths to earn money through working. During the Great Migration, many black women who came to the north, while free from their past oppression, now were faced with an economic struggle, highlighting the human hierarchy of needs. Isabel Wilkerson, In an NPR interview, talks about her engagement with a black woman with regard to the fight for opportunities in the north. She says, “black women would just show up and hoped to be picked by a white housewife who might need a little help in her home. And they would just - they would come very early in the morning and they would sit on crates waiting to be chosen, hoping to be picked, which also meant that that kept the wages down. They were so desperate that they might take almost anything just to be able to get a little money for the day.” (NPR). Despite their minimal wages, black men and women made the most of what they had, juxtaposed to the relative economic ease exhibited by whites. Despite this reality, Troy views himself as an integral part of the societal machine, and able to stack up against his white counterparts. This is evident when he questions why his garbage collection company only allows whites to drive the truck while blacks have to collect the garbage, and eventually, Troy would have the determination and courage to petition the union. He ended up becoming the first black garbage truck driver in Pittsburgh, paving the way for more to come, and cementing his position in society. This motif of future advancement is paralleled in Cory’s aim to become a professional football player and go on to college, embracing opportunities that his prior generations did not have as a result of social change for blacks in general. Ultimately, the context of race provides insight to the characters’ complex motivations, as well as the Maxson family’s place in society and views on authority.</p>
