      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This movie takes place in the 1950s during a time known as the great migration, after the dismantling of slavery, but before the civil rights movement. During this time the descendents of freed slaves and former poor sharecroppers traveled to urban centers in the North in search of a better life. Due to this background, a disproportionate part of the Black population during this time were poor. They lived in slums and worked hard labor jobs that were considered undesirable. Due to being economically disadvantaged, their opportunity was limited. Troy originally grew up in the developing city of Pittsburgh. He lived with his father who was a sharecropper, typical for black men. However, Troy was abused by his father, ran away from his home, and forced to become a man on his own. Troy’s childhood was one that was very common during this time period. Like Troy’s father, it was very common for black men to be sharecroppers, laboring away for money. This would often cause family issues, like in Troy’s case with child abuse and financial problems. Hence, such context surrounding Troy’s background helped explain his state as an adult. Being limited by opportunities and lacking the support of his father, Troy was forced to learn life’s lessons on his own from a very young age. And this development travelled into adulthood as he became a tough man. In an interview with Ms. Wilkerson who talks about her book regarding the Great Migration, she talks about one person’s experience of migrating to the North. She says, “I think her - she and her family - she and her husband actually, had probably the hardest time getting situated and finding work because they had the least skills of the three people that I've written about. They were both of the land and her husband, for example, first found work hauling ice up the, you know, three and four flights of stairs in the cold water flats on the South Side of Chicago.” (NJPR). This family’s first hand experience of the Great Migration and life in the North shows that blacks migrated for opportunity, but they were still limited and mostly only had labor jobs available for them.</p>
