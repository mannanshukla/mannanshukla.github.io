      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The 1950s were at a time where African Americans were able to work and own property, however their economic plights had not hit national awareness. The 1950s show that while a Black man could gain some opportunity, the deck was still stacked against him. In the movie Fences, Troy questioned his company why only whites drove garbage trucks while blacks were the ones who collected the garbage cans. Troy was able to petition the union to go from being a garbage collector to a driver for the garbage company he worked for. He was accepted, but had to fight for it. The time period of the 1950s in this movie shows how life was for a black man. Troy was able to get the opportunity of being able to become a driver, but he had to fight for this right. As a black man, Troy was able to work and gain opportunity, but his economic rights were not easily given. Things were getting better regarding the divide between whites and blacks during this time period, yet it was not at the point it needed to be at. In the NJPR interview with Ms. Wilkerson, she talks about how she learned from a black woman that migrated to the North for better opportunities that they suffered a lot just to gain job opportunities. She says, “black women would just show up and hoped to be picked by a white housewife who might need a little help in her home. And they would just - they would come very early in the morning and they would sit on crates waiting to be chosen, hoping to be picked, which also meant that that kept the wages down. They were so desperate that they might take almost anything just to be able to get a little money for the day.” (NJPR). Throughout this time period, African Americans started gaining some opportunities to flourish. This included black women who came to the North during the Great Migration for a better life, but that better life needed an unfair amount of fight and suffering to achieve. This “better life” was nothing compared to whites of the time period. Even very little wage opportunities were considered to be a great opportunity to live better. These women would be willing to do jobs like being maids to make money. But in the end, it was better than their initial situation - without money, opportunities, and jobs. Even with their limited chances, black women and men made the most of what they had available.</p>
