      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The last major context which provides important details about Maxson’s pursuit of their American Dream is the time period in which the movie takes place. Fences take place in an in-between time period: the 1950s. This was well after the abolition of slavery, however, this was also before the Civil Rights Movement. Thus, Jim Crow laws, blatant segregation, and open racism were highly pervasive throughout the South. During this new era, the descendants of slaves in the South began to move up to Northern cities in droves, in a mass movement of people now known as the Great Migration. The North wasn’t always so appealing to its immigrants. PBS’s series on the history of Black America, Judgement Day, put it in simple terms: “African Americans also faced violence at the hands of white northerners. Individual cases of assault and murder occurred throughout the North, as did daily insults and harassment. Between 1820 and 1850, Northern blacks also became the frequent targets of mob violence. Whites looted, tore down, and burned black homes, churches, schools, and meeting halls. They stoned, beat, and sometimes murdered blacks. Philadelphia was the site of the worst and most frequent mob violence. City officials there generally refused to protect African Americans from white mobs and blamed blacks for inciting the violence with their "uppity" behavior.” (PBS Paragraph 9). 100 years later, however, things had mostly changed. The Maxson’s, now settled in Pittsburgh as part of the Great Migration, saw themselves as equals to their White counterparts. Troy was able to fight for his right to drive the bus with probable cause, and he wasn’t afraid of his demands leading to a firing. Cory excelled at school as well. Despite this progress, however, there was still a deep-seated distrust and hatred of the other race from Troy. Troy knew how Blacks were still being treated in other parts of the country and felt resentment because he wasn’t able to join the MLB. He felt as though the White population had it out for him. Even with these setbacks, Blacks had made major progress in the march toward advancement. We were at a crossroads. Cory saw that he could go to college on a scholarship, something that wasn’t possible in the past. He had a path toward formal higher education, surely the first in his family to be given such a chance. Troy, with his previous work ethic, didn’t see the need for Cory to be taking such gambles. Troy was burned by the fact he wasn’t able to join the MLB simply due to his race. Something like this couldn’t have happened at any other time.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The unique time period also influenced Maxon’s thoughts on authority. Cory was quickly able to find Troy’s faults. While Troy isn’t as blatantly evil as Troy’s father, the advancements and opportunities for blacks made it obvious that Troy was trying to pull Cory back, whether it be to protect Cory or to stroke his ego. Cory argued with Troy regarding this and eventually left home following the spat. “You ain't never done nothing but hold me back, afraid I was gonna be better than you! All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.” (01:50:12). This was in an era where children could more easily stand up to and eventually leave home to forge their path. If this were the modern-day, something like this would be impossible. Cory was able to take matters into his own hands and join the Marines as a result. This time period made independence a priority, which worked in Cory’s favor. The 1940s and 1950s were the culmination of the Great Migration, Troy’s dream. He wanted to leave a society that hated him for a society where he could work hard and succeed. While Cory wanted to move forward through college as he saw the ills of urban life and the condition of black people, Troy was satisfied as there was already so much advancement from where he was. Overall, the context of the time period is very important in the contrasting commentary of the American Dream. For one, it shows that there was still major inequality, both in opportunity for work and school. However, Black people in America had advanced to such a degree that a new era of African Americans had dawned and this was the turning point. After Troy’s death, the impact of the Civil Rights Movement was easily seen as the camera panned to portraits of JFK and MLK hung up in the kitchen. Cory was finally able to have a shot at college, and little by little, sports were slowly being integrated as well. Even though the deck was still stacked against the Maxson family, they were able to take their opportunities by the neck and succeed in its wake.</p>
