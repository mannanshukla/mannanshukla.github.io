      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Pittsburgh, a Northern, industrial city, shows what life was like before the civil rights movement in the North, something that isn’t usually explored in the media. We learn that in spite of the deck being stacked against the black population by virtue of their socioeconomic status, there is still a spirit of integration, there is change looming. For the first time, Black people who take their opportunities are rewarded for it. In the movie Fences, Troy is shown working with whites for the garbage company. He is also shown living in an all black slum. Hence, his life is filled with integration, interacting with people of both colors. Troy’s life was still involved with white people even though he lived in an all black slum. His life shows life in Pittsburgh before the civil rights movement: integrated with whites even with society being against blacks. This tied into his work life as he aimed to grow in the garbage company he worked at. Fighting for his opportunities and equality, he overcame racial obstacles to become one of the garbage truck drivers - a position generally for a white person. Thus, along with all his personal problems, he had to deal with racial issues. But he was able to scout an opportunity, prove his case, and eventually end up in a better place. Whites and blacks were starting to integrate in this time period, but there was still a split between the races. As Pittsburgh developed into a more prosperous city, the opportunities for African Americans prospered as well. Gone were the days of mass segregation and now, African Americans were allowed to mix more with whites. Hence, this allowed even the youth to go to school with white kids and really integrate themselves with society at a young age. This also opened up new opportunities for these young black kids like gaining an actually valuable education and making connections with all types of people. This enabled many Black families to climb the social ranks in this time period, with more and more educated African Americans emerging to climb the latter of society.</p>
