	"<img src=\"fences.jpeg\" width=\"800\"> <p>By looking at the context of the time period, location, and race, we can see how the Maxson family views their place in society, future advancement, social change, along with thoughts on authority and generational shifts in ambition. Even though the deck is stacked against the Maxson family socially and economically, multiple characters take matters into their own hands and reap the benefits. This is important as it provides a contrasting and colorful commentary on the American Dream. Throughout the film, the real world problem of unequal opportunities is prevalent. This is shown through the story of Troy, a man who lives with his son, Cory, and wife, Rose, in Pittsburgh during the 1950s. Because of his low-income state, Troy is forced to use his brother’s, Gabriel, military injury compensation to place a down payment on his home. From there, Troy’s past is revealed as he is shown to be survivor of child abuse as well as being stopped from pursuing his dream of professional baseball due to racial barrers in the Major Leagues. Because of this, Troy wants Cory to forget his passion, football, and focus on making money. However, Cory opposes this, believing in himself to be successful. After Troy complains that his company is racist, he becomes the garbage truck driver. Troy cheats on Rose with a woman he meets at a bar, and Bono finds out about this. Bono tells him to cut off the woman, Alberta. After hearing that Cory did not go to his job, he tells his coach that he is not allowed to play football anymore, and he also doesn’t sign papers to let him get recruited for college football. This causes a physical altercation between Troy and Cory. Troy eventually drives Cory away, ruining their relationship for good. Six years later, Troy dies and his family comes together to remember him. Although he had sour relationships with Cory and Rose, they eventually put the past aside to say their final goodbyes. In the end, Troy’s family showed up for him and bid him farewell as he ascended to heaven.</p>",
	"<p>This movie takes place in the 1950s during a time known as the great migration, after the dismantling of slavery, but before the civil rights movement. During this time the descendents of freed slaves and former poor sharecroppers traveled to urban centers in the North in search of a better life. Due to this background, a disproportionate part of the Black population during this time were poor. They lived in slums and worked hard labor jobs that were considered undesirable. Due to being economically disadvantaged, their opportunity was limited. Troy originally grew up in the developing city of Pittsburgh. He lived with his father who was a sharecropper, typical for black men. However, Troy was abused by his father, ran away from his home, and forced to become a man on his own. Troy’s childhood was one that was very common during this time period. Like Troy’s father, it was very common for black men to be sharecroppers, laboring away for money. This would often cause family issues, like in Troy’s case with child abuse and financial problems. Hence, such context surrounding Troy’s background helped explain his state as an adult. Being limited by opportunities and lacking the support of his father, Troy was forced to learn life’s lessons on his own from a very young age. And this development travelled into adulthood as he became a tough man. In an interview with Ms. Wilkerson who talks about her book regarding the Great Migration, she talks about one person’s experience of migrating to the North. She says, “I think her - she and her family - she and her husband actually, had probably the hardest time getting situated and finding work because they had the least skills of the three people that I've written about. They were both of the land and her husband, for example, first found work hauling ice up the, you know, three and four flights of stairs in the cold water flats on the South Side of Chicago.” (NJPR). This family’s first hand experience of the Great Migration and life in the North shows that blacks migrated for opportunity, but they were still limited and mostly only had labor jobs available for them.</p><audio controls><source src=\"npr.mp3\"></audio><video controls><source src=\"http://wqed.vo.llnwd.net/o15/local-programs/360-2015-02-26.mp4\"></video>",
	"<p>The 1950s were at a time where African Americans were able to work and own property, however their economic plights had not hit national awareness. The 1950s show that while a Black man could gain some opportunity, the deck was still stacked against him. In the movie Fences, Troy questioned his company why only whites drove garbage trucks while blacks were the ones who collected the garbage cans. Troy was able to petition the union to go from being a garbage collector to a driver for the garbage company he worked for. He was accepted, but had to fight for it.  The time period of the 1950s in this movie shows how life was for a black man. Troy was able to get the opportunity of being able to become a driver, but he had to fight for this right. As a black man, Troy was able to work and gain opportunity, but his economic rights were not easily given. Things were getting better regarding the divide between whites and blacks during this time period, yet it was not at the point it needed to be at. In the NJPR interview with Ms. Wilkerson, she talks about how she learned from a black woman that migrated to the North for better opportunities that they suffered a lot just to gain job opportunities. She says, “black women would just show up and hoped to be picked by a white housewife who might need a little help in her home. And they would just - they would come very early in the morning and they would sit on crates waiting to be chosen, hoping to be picked, which also meant that that kept the wages down. They were so desperate that they might take almost anything just to be able to get a little money for the day.” (NJPR). Throughout this time period, African Americans started gaining some opportunities to flourish. This included black women who came to the North during the Great Migration for a better life, but that better life needed an unfair amount of fight and suffering to achieve. This “better life” was nothing compared to whites of the time period. Even very little wage opportunities were considered to be a great opportunity to live better. These women would be willing to do jobs like being maids to make money. But in the end, it was better than their initial situation - without money, opportunities, and jobs. Even with their limited chances, black women and men made the most of what they had available.</p><img src=\"family.jpg\" width=\"600\"><p>Caption text</p>",
	"<p>Pittsburgh, a Northern, industrial city, shows what life was like before the civil rights movement in the North, something that isn’t usually explored in the media. We learn that in spite of the deck being stacked against the black population by virtue of their socioeconomic status, there is still a spirit of integration, there is change looming. For the first time, Black people who take their opportunities are rewarded for it. In the movie Fences, Troy is shown working with whites for the garbage company. He is also shown living in an all black slum. Hence, his life is filled with integration, interacting with people of both colors. Troy’s life was still involved with white people even though he lived in an all black slum. His life shows life in Pittsburgh before the civil rights movement: integrated with whites even with society being against blacks. This tied into his work life as he aimed to grow in the garbage company he worked at. Fighting for his opportunities and equality, he overcame racial obstacles to become one of the garbage truck drivers - a position generally for a white person. Thus, along with all his personal problems, he had to deal with racial issues. But he was able to scout an opportunity, prove his case, and eventually end up in a better place. Whites and blacks were starting to integrate in this time period, but there was still a split between the races. As Pittsburgh developed into a more prosperous city, the opportunities for African Americans prospered as well. Gone were the days of mass segregation and now, African Americans were allowed to mix more with whites. Hence, this allowed even the youth to go to school with white kids and really integrate themselves with society at a young age. This also opened up new opportunities for these young black kids like gaining an actually valuable education and making connections with all types of people. This enabled many Black families to climb the social ranks in this time period, with more and more educated African Americans emerging to climb the latter of society.</p><img src=\"classroom.jpg\" width=\"600\"><p>Caption text</p>",
	"<p>By looking at the context of race, location, and time period presented in the world of the film Fences, we gain a more complete understanding of the values that various characters in and around the Maxson family hold. Despite the fact they live in a society in which they must overcome the odds to advance, various characters are able to take opportunities as they come and eventually overcome the bad hand they were dealt. Through this, Fences provides both a contrasting and colorful commentary on the American Dream. Discourse regarding the American Dream is typically black or white. Many decry the very idea of such a dream existing due to the fact that systematic racism allows some racial groups to jump ahead of others in terms of social standing and economics. Even in the wake of this reality, proponents argue that others just need to work harder, and that the dream dies due to laziness. Fences, however, shines light on a more nuanced view. By focusing on a little discussed period in American history, audiences across the world were exposed to an interpretation of the American Dream that balanced two contradictory, yet realistic points of view: where some will have to work extra hard to achieve the American Dream while facing unique obstacles and challenges, but the Dream is achievable nonetheless.</p>",
