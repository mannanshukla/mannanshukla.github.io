      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The United States of America is currently the world’s youngest developed nation. Despite our mere 250 years of existence, the history of the United States has been varied, multi-faceted, and downright fascinating. However, there are deep scars and dark stains that continue to plague our nation today. The impact of slavery and the treatment of African Americans on American society,  both then and now, continues to have a profound and pervasive impact on modern-day American life. August Wilson’s acclaimed play was adapted into Denzel Washington’s 2016 film Fences, which tells the story of the Maxson family. The breadwinner for the household, Troy, was cast out of his home at the age of 14 after a disturbing altercation with his father. After a life of homelessness and crime, he discovers his natural baseball talent. Upon his release, he joins the Negro Leagues and becomes one of its best players. As part of the great migration of the 1940s, he also moves up north to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately for Troy, despite his talent, he was never able to make it to the MLB purely because of his race. Eventually, Troy settles with Rose and has Cory, who becomes a talented football player in his own right. Due to Troy’s poor personal experience as a professional athlete, he refuses to sign Cory’s required permission slip to be recruited by colleges. While all this is happening, Troy has an affair with a Florida woman he meets in a bar, eventually leading to her carrying his child. Eventually, the woman passes during childbirth, causing Troy to beg Rose for forgiveness. Rose cares for the child but tells Troy he no longer has a woman. They continue to live together, estranged. Cory, much like his father prior, is thrown out of the home after an intense argument over Cory’s permission slip. He enlists in the Marine Corps following the incident. 6 years later, Troy passes from a heart attack. Cory and Rose learned to see Troy for his positive attributes and forgave him for the mistakes he made.</p>

	<p><em>By looking at the context of the time period, location, and race, we can see how the Maxson family views their place in society, future advancement, thoughts on authority, and generational shifts in ambition. Even though the deck is stacked against the Maxson family socially and economically, multiple characters take matters into their own hands and reap the benefits. This is important as it provides a contrasting and colorful commentary on the American Dream.</em></b>
