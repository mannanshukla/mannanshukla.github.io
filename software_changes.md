# Software Changes

## Organization

- Use Agile
	- Use Jira
	- no daily standups (those are hell) instead meet before and after each meeting to discuss progress

- Start new codebase using the singleton system

- Use Git
	- Stable Branch: updated before each competition
	- Beta Branch: master used for testing before competitions
	- Individual Branches: seperate people work on stuff and have their own branches, only merge to beta when needed

- Communication
	- Bring Freshman into the "in-group", take them on walks and do stuff with them to foster good relations and better communication

## Strategy

- Have someone grind online resources and present their findings after every meeting
	- chiefdelphi
	- /r/ftc
	- any ftc related discords

- Formulate strategies after kickoff
	- discuss findings with software team first
	- give proposals to build team along with software to get things done

## Training

- Git/Github

- Agile/Jira

- Singleton codebase

- Android Studio

- Code best practices
	- comment everything needed
	- write readable code
	- always push code that compiles (even to your own branch), make your own beta branch if needed
