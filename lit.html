<tr>
<td>Sensory Imagery</td>
<td>“I dreamed of jagged peaks lining a curving river, with magic moss greening the banks. At the tops of these peaks were white mists. And if you could float down this river and eat the moss for food, you would be strong enough to climb the peak. If you slipped, you would only fall into a bed of soft moss and laugh. And once you reached the top, you would be able to see everything and feel such happiness it would be enough to never have worries in your life ever again.” (Tan 7)</td>
<td>Suyuan describes Kweilin in great detail, like it’s the land of her and everyone else’s fantasies. This helped me understand her dissapointment and fear later on when it is revealed that the Japanese came to invade which sets up Suyuan escapaing to America. It sets us up for dissapointment and makes us more empathetic for Suyuan when she decides to leave her twins behind in China and flee to America.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Foil Character</td>
<td>“… how smart Waverly was at playing chess, how many trophies she had won in the last month, how many newspapers had printed her name, how many cities she had visited,” (Tan 27)</td>
<td>In this case, June is the main character and Waverly is the foil character. Suyuan is using Waverly to call attention to the lack of extra curriculars of June and that Waverly is far more successful. This made me understand the tension between mother and daughter</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rising Action</td>
<td>“I was sitting at the top of the stairs when she arrived. I knew it was my mother even though I had seen her in all my memory. She stood just inside the doorway so that her face became a dark shadow. She was much taller than my auntie, almost as tall as my uncle. She looked strange, too, like the missionary ladies at our school who were insolent and bossy in their too-tall shoes, foreign clothes, and short hair.” (Tan 36)</td>
<td>An-Mei is telling the story of her mother and their strained relationship which explains why she acts the way she does even when she becomes old herself, halfway around the world. She’s told by her family that her mother disgraced the entire family be remarrying and becoming a concubine and An-Mei was told to dislike her mother without even meeting her. This was until her mother actually ends up showing up. Finally, An-Mei sees her mother for the first time, how will her family react? How will her mother think of An-Mei? All of this serves as the rising action and serves to rise anticipation for the audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Climax</td>
<td>“My mother took her flesh and put it in the soup. She cooked magic in the ancient tradition to try to cure her mother this one last time. She opened Popo’s mouth, already too tight from trying to keep her spirit in. She fed her this soup, but that night Popo flew away with her illness.” (Tan 41)</td>
<td>After meeting her mother and her family showing their displeasure, An-Mei’s grandmother falls ill. Amy Tan uses a climax to show how all of the tension culminates for the sake of the lesson at the end. In this case, the mother makes the ultimate sacrifice for her own mother, cutting off her own flesh without regard for her own pain. The use of the climax helped me understand the flow of the story and made me realize that this was the most important part of this particular telling of events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Similie</td>
<td>“This means nothing to you, because to you promises mean nothing. A daughter can promise to come to dinner, but if she has a headache, if she has a traffic jam, if she wants to watch a favorite movie on TV, she no longer has a promise.” … “Promise! Promise! Honey-sweetheart, my promise is as good as gold." Then he pushes her onto the bed. But he doesn’t come back. His gold is like yours, it is only fourteen carats. To Chinese people, fourteen carats isn’t real gold. Feel my bracelets. They must be twenty-four carats, pure inside and out.”" (Tan 42)</td>
<td>Lindo explains the difference between promises from Chinese people and how they were more important and impactful than the empty promises that Lindo’s daughter makes, being an American. She lists all of the excuses her daughter makes. She also references a movie where an American soldier says his promise is as good as gold, but later breaks that promise. Lindo says “His gold is like yours, only 14 Carets” which isn’t enough for chinese people. She compares promises to gold. This made me understand that Lindo’s point is that a promise means more in Chinese culture than in American culture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contrast Imagery</td>
<td>“But his father lived and his grandmother was scared the ghosts would turn their attention to this baby boy and take him instead. So they watched him carefully, made all his decisions, and he became very spoiled.” … “I was actually a very obedient child, but sometimes I had a sour look on my face—only because I was hot or tired or very ill.” (Tan 45)</td>
<td>Lindo is trying to provide background info for why she later gets away from her husband. She uses contrast imagery to show the difference between her and her husband, which also serves to highlight the differences between how girls and boys were treated in China at the time. This helped me understand the situation better as it paints the husband himself in a poor light, and also gives further context in what was going on in Lindo’s mind at the time, and why she wanted to escape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Syntax</td>
<td>“A hand-written sign informed tourists, “Within this store, is all for food, not for pet.” ” … “The sanddabs made me shiver each time; their eyes lay on one flattened side and reminded me of my mother’s story of a careless girl who ran into a crowded street and was crushed by a cab. “Was smash flat,” reported my mother.” (Tan 91)</td>
<td>In this case, it’s Waverly speaking, an American through and through. She makes sure to show how in Chinatown, the culture was very different than the rest of America. She uses instances of broken English to show this, which breaks normal English syntax. I was able to understand the major differences between how it’s like in Chinatown vs the rest of the country as even signs for buisnesses are written in broken English.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personification</td>
<td>“A light wind began blowing past my ears. It whispered secrets only I could hear. “Blow from the South,” it murmured. “The wind leaves no trail.” I saw a clear path, the traps to avoid.” (Tan 98)</td>
<td>Waverly talks about her new found knack for chess, when playing against a high level boy from Oakland, she describes a wind which helps her out, probably a metaphor for her own instinct. This wind is also given a personification, telling her moves and showing traps like a coach. It helped me understand how Waverly’s instincts work to her benefit, like they’re clearing a fog. I got a heightened understanding of how Waverly operates while playing chess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prose</td>
<td>“Nah, she’ll just be glad I’m not dead or something. Oh, she’ll pretend to be mad, sort of. We do this kind of stuff all the time." And then she slipped through my window and soundlessly made her way back home. I stared at the open window for a long time, wondering about her. How could she go back? Didn’t she see how terrible her life was? Didn’t she recognize it would never stop?” (Tan 119)</td>
<td>Lena discovers that her neighbor, Tessa has gone to Lena’s house as a means of coming back to her own home because she wants to playfully spite her own mother. Lena finds this insane, and doesn’t understand how it could be possible. Amy Tan’s use of prose makes Lena’s thoughts to herself very clear. All of her thoughts are expressed as though they’re normal speech. This helped me understand Lena’s different perspective on the matter because it was easier to understand when give straight to me at face value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hyperbole</td>
<td>“The tests got harder—multiplying numbers in my head, finding the queen of hearts in a deck of cards, trying to stand on my head without using my hands, predicting the daily temperatures in Los Angeles, New York, and London.” (Tan 144)</td>
<td>June is describing her early childhood, where her mother raises her to become a superstar. As part of this training, June has to memorize meanial facts. June starts to lose her interest and focus. Amy Tan says that she was told to predict the weather, which is an exaggeration. This made me understand how June started to view these tests and why she ended up losing her interest in startdom soon thereafter.</td>

<p>Identify 5 methods outlined by Thomas C. Foster in his text How to Read Literature like a Professor demonstrated in The Joy Luck Club. Be sure to include text evidence. Explain how the chosen method adds to your understanding and analysis of the text.</p>
</blockquote><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Evidence</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A specifc cause of death</td>
<td>“‘But before it could come out of her mouth, the thought grew too big and burst. It must have been a very bad idea.’ The doctor said she died of a cerebral aneurysm” (Tan 5)“The fourth consideration-the metaphorical possibilities a disease offers-generally overrides all others: a sufficiently compelling metaphor can induce an author to bring an otherwise objectionable illness into a work,” (Foster 225).</td>
<td>Foster describes illnesses as metaphors for various ideas and experiences. In this case, the brain can be interpreted as the place where thoughts are held. Her own friends said she died like a rabbit, with unfinished buisness. Even June’s father speculates it must’ve been her thoughts that killed her. We find out about the planned reunion with the twin sisters June’s mother left in China and how the idea of them must’ve weighed on her heavilly and probably explains why June was treated so harshly as a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Markings</td>
<td>“He said there are three signs. First, he has drawn a black spot on Tyan-yu’s back, and this spot will grow and eat away Tyan-yu’s flesh just as it ate away our ancestor’s face before he died." Huang Taitai quickly turned to Tyan-yu and pulled his shirt up. “Ai-ya!” she cried, because there it was, the same black mole, the size of a fingertip, just as I had always seen it these past five months of sleeping as sister and brother.” (Tan 93) “But more often than not physical markings by their very nature call attention to themselves and signify some psychological or thematic point the writer wants to make. After all, it’s easier to introduce characters without imperfections. You give a guy a limp in Chapter 2, he can’t go sprinting after the train in Chapter 24. So if a writer brings up a physical problem or handicap or deficiency, he probably means something by it” (Foster 208)</td>
<td>Tyan-yu and his family are characterized as tyrants, unethical, too traditional and just downright evil by Lindo. Foster describes such deformaties as metaphors or just representations of objectionable morality held by the offending character. In this case, Tyan-yu has a mole on his back, which is a defining feature and is used by Lindo to escape his family. Lindo described Tyan-yu as someone who was spoiled, acted like an emperor and disrespected Lindo just for the sake of it. Amy Tan includes this detail about Tyan-yu to represent his poor morality, espicially towards Lindo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Irony</td>
<td>“To this day, I believe my mother has the mysterious ability to see things before they happen. She has a Chinese saying for what she knows. Chunwang chihan: If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. Which means, I suppose, one thing is always the result of another.” … “Fallen down," she says simply. She doesn’t apologize. “It doesn’t matter,” I say, and I start to pick up the broken glass shards. “I knew it would happen.” “Then why you don’t stop it?” asks my mother. And it’s such a simple question.” (Tan 161-181) “Whereas normally in literary works we watch characters who are our equals or even superiors, in an ironic work we watch characters struggle futilely with forces we might be able to overcome. Second, the specific situation of the road offers another level of irony.” (Foster 253)</td>
<td>Foster describes characters in the middle of ironic situations as central to the themes and ideas of the story. In this case, Lena is the central character, who is at the mercy of whatever happens to her through a superstition that her mom knew all due to the convienent death of her former neighbor. Fast forward a few years and Lena got rid of Arnold, but found Harold who is too fair with finances and refuses to show his love in the ways that Lena is looking for. Her unhappiness is characterized at the end of the chapter by Lena finding her mother broke the vase which symbolizes that the marriage cannot last. While most of the stories in the Joy Luck Club end with somewhat happy endings, this one so far ends with Lena feeling lost about her situation. The central message seems to be that one should put their own interests in their mind at all times, a case of self-determination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Geographical Symbolism</td>
<td>“Meanwhile she asks over and over again why we had to pay so much for a renovated barn and a mildew-lined pool on four acres of land, two of which are covered with redwood trees and poison oak. Actually she doesn’t really ask, she just says, “Aii, so much money, so much,” as we show her different parts of the house and land.” (Tan 169) “First, think about what there is down low or up high. Low: swamps, crowds, fog, darkness, fields, heat, unpleasantness, people, life, death. High: snow, ice, purity, thin air, clear views, isolation, life, death. Some of these, you will notice, appear on both lists, and you can make either environment work for you if you’re a real writer.” (Foster 284)</td>
<td>In this case, Lena and Harold’s residence is a “low” place, a rennovated barn which has its issues, considering that it’s still a barn after all. This low place can be interpreted to mean death, since part of this house is why Lena and Harold’s marriage didn’t last. They split everything, even maintaining the house. It’s not the best atmosphere and the home’s geography is used to symbolize how uneasy it is. This imbalence is also commented on by Lena’s mother throughout her visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A strong Heart</td>
<td>“And she was right. Despite all the tension she places on herself—and others—the doctors have proclaimed that my mother, at age sixty-nine, has the blood pressure of a sixteen-year-old and the strength of a horse. And that’s what she is. A Horse, born in 1918, destined to be obstinate and frank to the point of tactlessness. ” (Tan 183) “The Odyssey Homer has characters say of other characters that they have “a heart of iron,” iron being the newest and hardest metal known to men of the late Bronze Age. The meaning, if we allow for some slight variations of context, is tough-minded, resolute even to the point of hard-heartedness—in other words, just what we might mean by the same statements today. ” (Foster 216)</td>
<td>Lindo is known as the strong woman who was able to get away from her arranged marriage with wit and resourcefulness. Sometimes, she can seem to be overbearing and as a force of nature, especially by Waverly. Amy Tan uses the metaphor for a strong heart being indicitive of strength for Lindo. She has the blood pressure of someone with far more youth. We can also attribute this to Lindo’s courage to leave her bad situation in China, and for her boasting when Waverly was a chess prodigy. This line gives us further insight into the way Waverly sees her mother, and the way that Lindo is usually portrayed.</td>
