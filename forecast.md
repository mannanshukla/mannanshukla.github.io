# rvilleforcast planning document

## about
many internet connected weather stations equipped with humidity and temperature sensors (more to come soon i guess) placed in random places around Robbinsville's Town Center tracks data, then posts it to a server. The server will aggregate this data and various clients (cli, web, mobile) will be able to see this data.

## why?
experience, cool for the community, will make us learn and will make us use skills we already used in robotics
